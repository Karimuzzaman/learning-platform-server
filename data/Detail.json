Python if statement is one of the most commonly used conditional statements in programming languages. It decides whether certain statements need to be executed or not. It checks for a given condition, if the condition is true, then the set of code present inside the ” if ” block will be executed otherwise not. if-else: The statement itself says if a given condition is true then execute the statements present inside the “if block” and if the condition is false then execute the “else” block. The “else” block will execute only when the condition becomes false. It is the block where you will perform some actions when the condition is not true. if-else statement evaluates the Boolean expression. If the condition is TRUE then, the code present in the “ if “ block will be executed otherwise the code of the “else“ block will be executed. elif statement: In Python, we have one more conditional statement called “elif” statements. “elif” statement is used to check multiple conditions only if the given condition is false. It’s similar to an “if-else” statement and the only difference is that in “else” we will not check the condition but in “elif” we will check the condition. “elif” statements are similar to “if-else” statements but “elif” statements evaluate multiple conditions. Nested if-else:  Nested “if-else” statements mean that an “if” statement or “if-else” statement is present inside another if or if-else block. Python provides this feature as well, this in turn will help us to check multiple conditions in a given program. elif ladder: We have seen about the “elif” statements but what is this elif ladder? As the name itself suggests a program that contains a ladder of “elif” statements or “elif” statements are structured in the form of a ladder. This statement is used to test multiple expressions.",
